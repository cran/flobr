Description: Converts files to and from flobs.  A flob is a file that was
    read into binary in integer-mode as little endian, saved as the single
    element of a named list (where the name is the name of the original
    file) and then serialized before being coerced into a blob.  Flobs are
    useful for writing and reading files to and from databases.
